# Dotfiles

This is a (very) basic collection of dotfiles, mostly targeted for a Mac environment. I'm a fairly
vanilla user of most of these tools, both because I'm lazy and when I'm not lazy I prefer
portability across systems. The only intended audience here is myself, but if you find something
useful that's a bonus. Use these at your own risk, and be sure you understand what these settings do
before blindly applying them.

## Bash

I pretty much only use Bash professionally these days, so there's not much to see here. I'll
probably expand this over time anyway.

## Emacs

I've never quite been able to shake my fascination with Emacs, but I am a casual user at
best. Mostly, I stick with Org mode, which is quite handy for day-to-day tracking and planning. I'm
trying to lean into org-roam lately as well. Emacs is good for bigger tasks and repository
management when VS Code or a proper IDE is not available.

## vim

Yeah, I use them both. Tools for the job and whatnot. I like vim for read-only or small tasks.

## zsh

By the time I get done with my day job(s), the last thing I want to do is fuss around with too much
configuration. I offload most of the thinking here to ohmyzsh, but I reserve the right to crash my
system however I see fit when the mood strikes.
